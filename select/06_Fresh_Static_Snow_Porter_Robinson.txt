You'd fit perfectly to me and we'd end our loneliness
Melt this curse away
Though I'll never know your name I'll cry for you the same
You'd fit perfectly to me and we'd end our loneliness
Melt this curse away
Though I'll never know your name I'll cry for you the same

You'd fit perfectly to me and we'd end our loneliness
Melt this curse away
Though I'll never know your name I'll cry for you the same
You'd fit perfectly to me and we'd end our loneliness
Melt this curse away
Though I'll never know your name I'll cry for you the same

Melt this curse away

Cry for you the same

Don't move so lightly, static snow, that is your memory
Although I know we'll never meet you're in every part of me
You'd fit perfectly to me and we'd end our loneliness
Melt this curse away
Though I'll never know your name I'll cry for you the same
